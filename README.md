Software developer with a strong interest in web development. Experienced in JavaScript, Typescript, React.js, and Node.js. Dedicated to delivering high-quality results and always eager to learn and improve.

I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects in my previous roles, from building responsive and user-friendly interfaces to developing efficient back-end systems. While I am confident in my ability to tackle any project that comes my way, I am also humbly aware that there is always more to learn and new challenges to embrace. I am excited to join a team where I can contribute my skills and continue to grow as a developer.
